## What is this?

This is my submission for the
[Codedex Mini Holiday Hackathon 2024](https://www.codedex.io/holiday-hackathon).
This project is about re-creating a modern company website as if it were in the
90's.

For this project, I decided to redesign the Suntory Horoyoi webpage by
re-imagining it as an interactive experience. Here, you'll be able to check out
the different Horoyoi chu-hi flavors available.
